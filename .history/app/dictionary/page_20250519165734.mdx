# API Documentation 👨‍💻
## Overview
The Dictionary API offers a simple and efficient way to access word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and parts of speech. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate into your applications.


## Authentication
To use the Dictionary API, users must authenticate with a valid API key. You can obtain your personal API key by signing in to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.fonders.org)
Please include a X-API-KEY header in your request or use our SDK's (coming soon!)

## Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage of our API, we have implemented rate limiting. Each user is allowed a maximum of 900 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. This limit is subject to change, so please check our documentation for the latest information.

## Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `/dictionary/v1/{word}`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**:
  - `word` (string, required): The word you want to look up.


## Example

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
