# Getting Started

Welcome to our documentation! This guide will help you get started with our API and provide you with the necessary information to make the most out of it.

## Base URL

All endpoints are served over HTTPS:

```bash
https://api.fonders.org
```

## Authentication
Currently, we do not require authentication for accessing our API. However, this is subject to change in the future. Please check our documentation regularly for updates on authentication requirements.

## Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage of our API, we have implemented rate limiting. Each user is allowed a maximum of 100 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
This limit is subject to change, so please check our documentation for the latest information.

## Error Handling
In case of an error, our API will return a JSON response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Error message describing the issue."
}
```
