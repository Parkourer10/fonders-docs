# Response Structure ðŸ“°
The response structure for the Dictionary API is designed to be simple and easy to understand. Below is the structure of the response you can expect when you make a request to the API.

Here's an example of a successful response when looking up a word:
```json
{
  "word": "example",
  "language": "English",
  "entries": [
    {
      "part_of_speech": "noun",
      "definitions": [
        {
          "text": "Something that is representative of all such things in a group."
        },
        //..
      ]
    },
    {
      "part_of_speech": "verb",
      "definitions": [

          "text": "To be illustrated or exemplified (by)."
        }
      ]
    }

    "Plant breeding is always a numbers game.[â€¦]The wild species we use are rich in genetic variation, [â€¦]. In addition, we are looking for rare alleles, so the more plants we try, the better. These rarities may be new mutations, or they can be existing ones that are neutralâ€”or are even selected againstâ€”in a wild population. A good example is mutations that disrupt seed dispersal, leaving the seeds on the heads long after they are ripe.",
