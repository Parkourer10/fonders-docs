# Response structure ðŸ“°
The response structure for the Translator API is designed to be simple and easy to understand. Below is the structure of the response you can expect when you make a request to the API.

Hereâ€™s an example of a successful response when looking up a translation (from English to Spanish for "hello"):

```json copy
{
  "src_lang": "en",
  "tgt_lang": "es",
  "text": "hello",
  "translation": "hola"
}
```
